If I could AWS Cloud to host this solution, I would use the following services:

 - AWS API Gateway + AWS Lambda to host the REST API (which would represent the api.py file)

 - AWS Glue to create a job that would do the ingestion of the CSV data, including the transformations (which 
 would represent database_handler.py file). Here the solution would be more scalable, because I would be able to use 
 PySpark and its distributed architecture. It would be possible to use AWS EMR as well for this task.

 - In terms of database, AWS Redshift or AWS Aurora could be used as the database, depending on the budget of the project.
 I'm not considering S3 here because one of the requirements is to use a SQL database. Othewise, S3 + Athena would be a 
 good option.
